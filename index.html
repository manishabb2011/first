                                <p>Mafunzo has been conceptualized and created as an organization to design and deliver training, mentoring, and skill development requirements across the spectrum for our discerning clients. 
To us at Mafunzo, training is a method to manage and sustain change, develop a skill, refocus knowledge and  re-define attitude via structured interventions aimed at optimizing performance . As such , continuous learning and improvement is critical to an  individual or an  organization and impacts their desired outcome for any activity directly or indirectly. 
This underlying principle helps us design and deliver structured practical training interventions that impact outcome, business or otherwise, positively. By positive impact we mean that our programs or solutions provide the right blend of knowledge and skills to our trainees / students / participants to enable them to perform a job more effectively.  
At Mafunzo, we draw on our extensive corporate and entrepreneurial experience of customer lifecycle value and continuous improvement to enable us to deliver these interventions more effectively. Our intense focus on the customized designing of learning programs, the adaptive methodology and the quality of delivery ensure that we meet the requirements each and every time.
